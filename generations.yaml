    description: "The original Peugeot 2008 was introduced as a compact crossover SUV based on the 208 hatchback platform, but with increased ride height, more rugged styling elements, and optional Grip Control enhanced traction system for light off-road capability. The exterior design featured a blend of hatchback and SUV styling cues with plastic body cladding, roof rails, and distinctive front grille. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a range of gasoline engines from 1.2L to 1.6L and diesel options from 1.4L to 1.6L, paired with manual or automatic transmissions driving the front wheels only (no all-wheel drive was offered). The interior showcased Peugeot's i-Cockpit design philosophy with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument cluster for improved visibility, a high-mounted dashboard, and premium materials unusual for its segment. Available technology included a touchscreen infotainment system, panoramic glass roof, and Park Assist. A mild refresh in 2016 brought styling updates including a more vertical grille design, additional body cladding, and expanded equipment offerings. Throughout its production, the first-generation 2008 established itself as a practical, stylish alternative in the rapidly growing small crossover segment, combining the maneuverability of a supermini with elevated seating position and enhanced practicality, particularly successful in European markets."

    description: "The second-generation Peugeot 2008 features dramatically more distinctive styling with a bold, aggressive front fascia featuring LED 'fang' daytime running lights, a more muscular stance, and contrasting body elements creating a more substantial SUV appearance compared to its predecessor. Built on PSA's new CMP (Common Modular Platform) shared with other Peugeot-CitroÃ«n-DS models, it grew significantly in all dimensions providing improved passenger space and cargo capacity. Powertrain options expanded to include various PureTech gasoline engines (100-155 hp), BlueHDi diesel options in some markets, and notably, a fully electric e-2008 variant with a 50 kWh battery providing approximately 193 miles (310 km) of range. The interior received a comprehensive upgrade with the latest evolution of Peugeot's i-Cockpit featuring a 3D digital instrument display, 10-inch touchscreen on higher trims, and distinctive piano-key style toggle switches. Advanced technology includes available adaptive cruise control, lane positioning assist, automated parking, and a full suite of driver assistance features. Material quality improved substantially with more premium soft-touch surfaces and ambient lighting. The Grip Control enhanced traction system continues as an option on combustion models, while the electric e-2008 variant shares its powertrain with the e-208, offering 136 horsepower and rapid charging capabilities. This generation positions the 2008 as a more upscale, technology-focused offering in the compact crossover segment, available with multiple powertrain options to suit different market preferences while maintaining distinctive French design philosophy and driving characteristics."
